## Who I Am

I'm a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering, with a focus on applying machine learning techniques to provide personalized diagnostic systems. My work spans from **computer vision** on histological images to models based on **omics data**.

This blog, **BME Log**, is my personal log of what I'm currently studying and working on.

## The Purpose of This Blog

The primary goal of this space is not monetization, but rather a "gentle nudge" to keep my learning active and consistent. It's a place where I'm not just passively reading papers, but actively working to internalize them. As Richard Feynman famously said, the best way to learn something is to explain it in simple terms. By writing these posts, I'm testing my own understanding and reinforcing my knowledge.

Publishing my thoughts publicly also helps me stay on a regular schedule, provides an avenue for constructive feedback, and allows me to connect with fellow researchers and experts who can offer new perspectives or correct potential errors.

## What You'll Find Here

I aim to share my notes on research papers that I find particularly interesting, as well as on my own projects. I'll present complex topics in a simple, yet accurate, way.

While the topics here are limited to my specific interests and don't encompass the entirety of biomedical engineering, I hope this blog can serve as an accessible starting point for those new to the field. Consider it a resource to find initial inspiration and resources without needing an extensive academic background.

Ultimately, this is a record of my learning journey. It's an invitation to others to join the conversation.
