## Overview

EAGLE (Efficient Approach for Guided Local Examination) is a deep learning framework designed to overcome one of the main limitations in computational pathology, namely the high computational cost of analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs). These images have gigapixel resolution, which makes traditional computer vision methods extremely resource-intensive.

The approach taken by EAGLE is inspired by the way pathologists work. Pathologists first perform a low-resolution overview of the slide to identify regions that require closer examination. Similarly, EAGLE first performs a coarse analysis to detect the most relevant regions and then applies high-resolution analysis to these areas to make predictions.

## Two-Step Workflow of EAGLE

EAGLE analyzes each WSI in two stages:

1. **Coarse Analysis:** All tiles of the WSI are processed using a lightweight tile encoder (CTransPath) at a lower resolution (2 microns per pixel). The embeddings generated from this stage are passed through the slide-level foundation model CHIEF. Instead of using CHIEF in the conventional way to generate a global embedding, the model's transformer attention matrix is extracted, which provides an importance score for each tile.

2. **Fine Analysis:** The top 25 most informative tiles, as indicated by the attention matrix, are re-analyzed using a more powerful tile encoder (Virchow2). These refined embeddings are aggregated to produce a final vector, which is used to generate the slide-level prediction.

## Comprehensive Benchmarking

The authors conducted extensive benchmarking across 31 tasks spanning four major cancer types: breast cancer (BRCA), colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (STAD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tasks included morphological classification, biomarker prediction, and prognostic assessment.

EAGLE was compared against 12 state-of-the-art baseline models, including both slide-level encoders (TITAN, COBRA, CHIEF, Prism, MADELEINE, Prov-GigaPath) and tile-level encoders (Virchow2, CONCH v1.5, CONCH, Prov-GigaPath, CTransPath, Virchow). All models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on TCGA datasets, with external validation on independent cohorts (CPTAC, DACHS, Kiel, Bern, IEO) to ensure generalizability.

### Performance and Efficiency

EAGLE demonstrated remarkable results across several dimensions:

- **Predictive Accuracy:** EAGLE achieved the highest average AUROC of 0.742 across all 31 tasks, with ensemble predictions reaching 0.750. It excelled in biomarker prediction tasks (0.772 AUROC), outperforming top competitors such as TITAN (0.763) and COBRA (0.757).

- **Unprecedented Efficiency:** EAGLE processed WSIs in an average of 2.27 seconds, reducing computational time by over 99% compared to resource-intensive alternatives. For reference, Prov-GigaPath required around 16 minutes per WSI, while CONCH v1.5 took over 3 minutes.

- **Robustness in Low-Data Scenarios:** In few-shot learning settings (k = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 samples per class), EAGLE consistently matched or outperformed the best baseline models, demonstrating its utility for rare biomarkers or disease subtypes.

## Increased interpretability and clinical relevance

A key advantage of EAGLE is its improved interpretability. Review by certified pathologists revealed that tiles selected by EAGLE contained significantly fewer artifacts than the supervised baselines (22% vs 32% general artifacts, 1% vs 15% pen marks). The framework consistently focused on the most representative tumor tissue, whereas baseline methods often included a confusing mix of healthy, tumor, and artifact-rich regions.

UMAP visualizations showed that EAGLE generates meaningful slide embeddings that effectively capture morphological diversity and enable clear separation by cancer type. The framework also supports efficient slide retrieval for similar-case searches, facilitating rapid diagnosis and cohort assembly.

## Clinical Impact and Future Directions

EAGLE represents a paradigm shift toward intelligent, pathologist-aligned computational pathology. By achieving real-time processing speeds while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability, EAGLE addresses key barriers to clinical adoption of AI in pathology. The framework's efficiency democratizes access to sophisticated deep learning models, potentially enabling deployment in resource-limited settings and smaller laboratories.

The interpretable tile selection mechanism builds trust with pathologists by providing clear visual evidence for predictions, while the unified slide-level representations facilitate integration into broader clinical AI systems. EAGLE's robust performance in data-scarce scenarios particularly positions it for advancing research in rare diseases and emerging biomarkers.

While the authors acknowledge limitations in handling highly heterogeneous tumor areas and the need for prospective clinical validation, EAGLE establishes a strong foundation for translating computational pathology from research environments into routine clinical practice. The framework's core innovation, combining global tissue assessment with focused detailed analysisâ€”offers a scalable approach that aligns AI capabilities with established pathological workflows.
