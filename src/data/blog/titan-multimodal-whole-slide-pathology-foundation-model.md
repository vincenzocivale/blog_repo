## Introduction

Foundation models are rapidly transforming the field of computational pathology, providing powerful tools for critical clinical applications such as diagnosis, prognosis, and biomarker prediction. These models are typically developed using self-supervised learning on millions of histology image patches, capturing fundamental morphological patterns. However, applying these patch-based models to address complex patient- and slide-level challenges remains a significant hurdle. The immense scale of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs), combined with limited clinical data in specific cohorts, poses a major obstacle, particularly in the context of rare diseases where effective model development is constrained by data scarcity.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Transformer-based pathology Image and Text Alignment Network (TITAN), a novel multimodal whole-slide vision-language model. TITAN is engineered for general-purpose slide representation learning, adapting successful patch-level training recipes to operate at the whole-slide scale. This is achieved through a novel paradigm that leverages large-scale, resolution-agnostic pre-training on millions of high-resolution regions-of-interest (ROIs) and entire WSIs.

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive technical overview of the TITAN model. We will examine its core architecture, detail its innovative three-stage pre-training methodology, and present a summary of its performance across a diverse range of clinical tasks. This analysis will illuminate how TITAN produces immediately applicable, off-the-shelf representations that simplify clinical model development without requiring task-specific finetuning, especially in data-constrained scenarios.

## TITAN Model Architecture

The architectural design of TITAN is strategically significant, as it successfully adapts proven patch-level self-supervised learning recipes, such as the Vision Transformer (ViT), to operate at the whole-slide level. Instead of processing raw image tokens from a partitioned image patch, TITAN's slide encoder processes a sequence of pre-extracted patch features. This design choice preserves high-resolution morphological detail while enabling computationally efficient analysis of gigapixel-scale images.

### Core Framework

TITAN is fundamentally a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture composed of 6 Transformer layers, 12 attention heads (each with a dimension of 64), and a final embedding dimension of 768. Unlike a conventional ViT that operates on raw image data, TITAN processes a sequence of patch features extracted by a powerful, pre-trained histology patch encoder. In this framework, the patch encoder effectively assumes the role of the "patch embedding layer," allowing the model to focus on learning contextual relationships between high-level morphological features rather than learning them from scratch.

### Input Processing and Feature Extraction

The model's ability to handle whole-slide images begins with a robust preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline:

1. **WSI Tiling:** Whole-slide images are preprocessed by segmenting the tissue area and tiling it into a grid of non-overlapping 512×512 pixel patches at 20× magnification. Using a larger patch size (compared to the common 256×256) reduces the input sequence length by a factor of four without compromising representation quality.
2. **Feature Extraction:** For each patch, a 768-dimensional feature vector is extracted using the CONCHv1.5 patch encoder. This encoder is robust across diverse tissue types and staining protocols, including H&E, frozen tissue, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
3. **Spatial Arrangement:** The extracted patch features are arranged into a 2D feature grid that mirrors the spatial positions of the corresponding patches within the original tissue, preserving critical spatial context for downstream analysis.

### Positional Encoding for Long-Context Extrapolation

A key challenge in whole-slide image analysis is handling the long and variable input sequences, which can exceed 10,000 tokens per slide. To address this and enable effective context modeling, TITAN employs a specialized positional encoding scheme.

The model utilizes Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), a technique originally developed for large language models to handle long sequences. ALiBi was extended to 2D for TITAN, where the linear bias applied during attention calculation is based on the relative Euclidean distance between patch features in the 2D grid. This innovative approach allows the model to be pre-trained on smaller, computationally manageable region crops (8,192×8,192 pixels) and then effectively extrapolate its learned spatial understanding to the entire, arbitrarily large WSI during inference—a "train short, test long" strategy that is crucial for practical application.

This sophisticated architecture provides the foundation for TITAN's powerful representation learning, which is cultivated through a multi-stage pre-training process.

## Three-Stage Pre-training Methodology

The strategic rationale behind TITAN's three-stage pre-training methodology is to build a slide representation that captures rich histomorphological semantics at multiple scales. This phased approach integrates unimodal visual learning with multimodal vision-language alignment, ensuring the final model understands both fine-grained regional patterns and high-level slide-wide diagnostic concepts.

## Overview of Pre-training Data

The primary dataset used for pre-training is Mass-340K, an extensive and diverse collection of pathology data. Its key characteristics ensure the model learns generalizable features applicable across a wide range of clinical contexts.

* Total WSIs: 335,645
* Organ Diversity: Distributed across 20 different organ types.
* Stain Types: Includes both Hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) stained slides (90.9%) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides (9.1%).
* Tissue Types: Comprises a mix of neoplastic (70.0%) and non-neoplastic (30.0%) tissues.

### Three-Stage Pre-training Process

#### Stage 1: Vision-Only Unimodal Pre-training (TITANV)

The first stage focuses on learning robust visual representations from image data alone, without text supervision. This is accomplished using the iBOT framework, which combines student-teacher knowledge distillation with masked image modeling.

A key component is the "view generation" process: for each WSI, a 16×16 feature region crop (8,192×8,192 pixels) is randomly sampled. From this region, two larger global crops (14×14 features) and ten smaller local crops (6×6 features) are generated. This multi-view approach encourages the model to learn consistent representations across different spatial scales. The resulting model from this stage is called **TITANV**.

#### Stage 2: ROI-Level Vision-Language Alignment

In the second stage, the model is aligned with fine-grained morphological descriptions at the Region-of-Interest (ROI) level. This step enhances the model's understanding of specific pathological concepts described in text.

Fine-tuning is performed using the Contrastive Captioners (CoCa) pre-training strategy on a dataset of 423,122 pairs of 8K×8K ROIs and their corresponding synthetic captions. These captions are generated by PathChat, a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology, providing rich and detailed descriptions that surpass typical clinical report summaries.

#### Stage 3: WSI-Level Vision-Language Alignment

The final stage aligns the model with high-level diagnostic descriptions from clinical pathology reports at the whole-slide level. This enables the model to connect regional features to overall slide-level diagnoses.

This stage also uses the CoCa framework for continual pre-training, leveraging a dataset of 182,862 pairs of WSIs and their associated pathology reports. Upon completion, the model becomes the fully multimodal **TITAN**.

This structured three-stage process equips TITAN with a nuanced, multi-scale understanding of pathology, enabling its strong performance in diverse clinical tasks.

## Performance Evaluation 

To validate its capabilities, TITAN underwent a comprehensive evaluation, benchmarking its performance against several existing slide foundation models (PRISM, GigaPath, CHIEF) and established baselines (mean pooling, Attention-based MIL). The evaluation spanned a diverse array of clinically relevant tasks, including morphological subtyping, molecular classification, few-shot learning, and cross-modal applications.

### Morphological and Molecular Classification

Linear probing evaluations, where a simple linear classifier is trained on the model's frozen slide embeddings, demonstrated TITAN's superior representation quality.

* Morphological Subtyping: On average, both TITAN and TITANV outperformed other slide encoders. TITAN particularly excelled in challenging morphological subtyping tasks, achieving an average performance improvement of +8.4% over the next-best model, PRISM. Its robustness was confirmed on both ROI-level tasks (e.g., TCGA-UT-8K) and WSI-level tasks that require long-context extrapolation (e.g., TCGA-OT, OT108).
* Molecular Classification: TITAN also consistently delivered the best performance on molecular classification tasks across multiple datasets, showcasing its ability to capture subtle features correlated with molecular status.


### Cross-Modal Capabilities

The vision-language alignment in Stages 2 and 3 equips TITAN with powerful cross-modal capabilities, far exceeding those of prior models like PRISM.

Capability	TITAN Performance	Key Insight
Zero-Shot Classification	Outperforms PRISM by a large margin, achieving a +56.52% increase in balanced accuracy on multi-class tasks.	Superior vision-language alignment from multi-resolution (ROI and WSI) pre-training.
Report Generation	Outperforms PRISM by an average of 161% across METEOR, ROUGE, and BLEU metrics on a TCGA report generation task.	The model can accurately capture and describe key diagnostic attributes from a WSI.
Cross-Modal Retrieval	Outperforms PRISM on both report-to-slide retrieval (+10.5%) and slide-to-report retrieval (+20.5%).	The shared embedding space effectively links visual and textual pathological concepts.

### Rare Cancer Retrieval

A critical clinical support function is retrieving similar cases from large archives, especially for diagnostically challenging or rare cancers.

On the Rare-Cancer retrieval task, which includes 186 distinct cancer types, TITAN and TITANV demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. They outperformed the next-best model, PRISM, by +14.8% and +12.3% in Accuracy@K, respectively. This highlights the model's ability to create a well-organized embedding space that clusters even scarce cancer types effectively.

These results consistently position TITAN as a leading foundation model for a new generation of computational pathology tools.

## Conclusion

The TITAN model represents a significant advance in computational pathology, establishing a new benchmark for multimodal, whole-slide foundation models. By successfully adapting and elevating state-of-the-art self-supervised learning recipes from the patch level to the slide level, TITAN produces powerful, general-purpose representations that excel across a wide spectrum of clinical applications. Its performance underscores the value of its unique architecture and innovative training methodology.
